# BeehiveZ-NJU
Process Model Similarity Measuring and COmplete Log Generator

BeehiveZ is developed by Institute of Information System and Engineering, School of Software, Tsinghua University, used for business process model and business process instance management, covering the topics of mining, comparison, indexing, query and so on.

We implement both of TLP(Token Log Profile)-based process model similarity measuring and #TAR complete log generating approaches in BeehiveZ. The zip package here contains all you need.  

If you want to use initial version of BeehiveZ, please refer to https://github.com/jintao05/BeehiveZ. 

If you already get the project of BeehiveZ, you could just download the 'cn.zip' to substitute that in 'src' folder.
