# BeehiveZ-NJU
Process Model Similarity Measuring

BeehiveZ is developed by Institute of Information System and Engineering, School of Software, Tsinghua University, used for business process model and business process instance management, covering the topics of mining, comparison, indexing, query and so on.

We implement both of our process model similarity measuring and #TAR complete log generating approaches in BeehiveZ. Here are only the code of the package "cn.edu". You should copy the code here and paste and substitute those in "src" folder of the initial BeehiveZ project.
